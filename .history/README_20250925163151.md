## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations
### Assumptions
1) Username Uniqueness: Assumes usernames should be unique across the application

2) Session-Based Authentication: Relies on browser sessions rather than persistent accounts

3) Single Vote Policy: Each user can vote only once per session

4) Real-Time Requirements: Assumes WebSocket connections are available and stable

### Limitations
No Password Protection: Username-only login may not be suitable for sensitive voting

Session Dependency: Clearing browser data will reset voting capability

Scalability: Current implementation may need optimization for large-scale voting

No Admin Panel: Limited administrative controls for vote management

Browser Storage: Relies on localStorage which can be cleared by users

No Audit Trail: Limited logging for vote verification and auditing

Mobile Limitations: Some real-time features may be less reliable on mobile networks
